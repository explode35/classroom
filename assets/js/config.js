   Doodle Desk — site configuration
   Single source of truth for plans and pricing. Both pricing.html and
   subscribe.html read from here, so a price change only happens once.

   To take real money you need a server that can talk to Stripe with a SECRET
   key (never put a secret key in this file — it ships to the browser).
   Set CHECKOUT_ENDPOINT below to your own endpoint and the subscribe form
   will POST to it and follow the returned Checkout URL. Until then the form
   runs in demo mode: it validates everything and shows a confirmation.
   See README.md for the ~40 lines of server code required.
